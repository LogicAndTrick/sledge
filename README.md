Sledge
======

*[Sledge alpha has been released! It's ready!][2]*

Sledge is an open source alternative to Valve's Hammer Editor for the Goldsource and Source engines. It is written in .NET and uses OpenGL as a rendering platform.

Currently Sledge supports Goldsource mapping in a limited capacity - features will be added during the alpha. A number of file format parsers are currently available, including FGD, RMF, VMF, MDL (limited support), and WAD (via [HLLib][1]).

While progress is slow, I have every intention of continuing work on this project. The current focus is on Goldsource support. After that, Source will be added, followed by a plugin system and more features.

The Sledge Editor is GPL. All other components are LGPL.
